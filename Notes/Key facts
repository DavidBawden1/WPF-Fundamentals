WPF Notes. 

1. Xaml doesnt need wpf & wpf doesnt need xaml. 
2. Anything that can be done in xaml can be done in code. 

Controls
1.Lookless control has no intrinsic look. 
2.Use markups to display looks based on scenarios. 

Framework element is the base of all controls. 

Layout - Panel types
1.Grid: enhanced table/grid-based layout.
2.Canvas: Fixed layout; also supports anchoring.
3.StackPanel: left to right or top to bottom.
4.DockPanel: Similar to Windows forms docking.
5.WrapPanel: flow-like formatting.

Data Binding 
1.Connects to objects or to xml. 
2.Uses information from objects and displays that to the screen.  
3.Data Templates superceeded winforms grids. 

Designers
1.Expression Blend

Range controls
1.Slider
2.Progress bar 
3.Scroll Bar

ListView vs List Box. ListView provides column headers!

Content Models           & Child Controls
ContentControl           | Button, Label
Headered Content Control | GroupBox, TabItem
Items Control            | ListBox, ComboBox
Headered Items Control   | MenuItem, TreeViewItem

each item in these controls is wrapped inside an item container. i.e ListBoxItem, ListViewItem and so on so forth.

Events and commands 
1.Bubbling starts from the child element and bubbles up to parent. 
2.Tunnelling starts from the parent and tunnnels down to the children elements. 
3.Direct events are raised at the target element.


Routed Events
1.The control the event is attached to becomes the sender. i.e. adding button click event handlers to a stack panel means the sender is the stack panel. 
	1. use the routedEventHandler Source to get the correct type. i.e. The button click event.
